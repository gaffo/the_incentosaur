Easily add "Gravatars":http://gravatar.com to your Ruby objects.


h2. Install

  sudo gem install gravtastic


h2. Usage

Somewhere in your application you need to @require 'gravtastic'@. In Rails >= 2.1 you can forego this and just add a dependency gem dependency for Gravtastic.

    config.gem 'gravtastic'

If you are using Merb & DataMapper you can add do the same by adding the following to your init.rb file:

  dependency 'gravtastic'

Make sure you add this after either the @use_orm :datamapper@ line or after a DataMapper extension. The next step is to give your model a Gravatar:

  class User
    is_gravtastic
  end

If you are using a standard Ruby class you have to add the line @include Gravtastic::Resource@ before @is_gravtastic@.
  
This defaults to looking for the gravatar ID on the @email@ method. So, if your @User@ has an @email@ then it will send that to Gravatar to get their picture. You can change the default gravatar source like this:

  is_gravtastic :with => :author_email

Now, you can access your object's gravatar with the @gravatar_url@ method:

  current_user.gravatar_url
  => "http://gravatar.com/e9e719b44653a9300e1567f09f6b2e9e.png?r=PG"

Note that it defaults to a PG rating. You can specify extra options with a hash:

  current_user.gravatar_url(:rating => 'R18', :size => 512)
  => "http://gravatar.com/e9e719b44653a9300e1567f09f6b2e9e.png?r=R18&s=512"
  
  current_user.gravatar_url(:secure => true)
  => "https://secure.gravatar.com/e9e719b44653a9300e1567f09f6b2e9e.png?r=PG"
  
However, to DRY things up you can specify defaults in the class declaration.

  is_gravtastic :with => :author_email, :rating => 'R18', :size => 20

Nice, now all the calls to gravatar_url will have the defaults you have specified. Any options that you pass when you use @gravatar_url@ will over-ride these class-defaults.

PS.  Bonus points for anybody who can tell me what that users email is!
